[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ProtonMail/vobject/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=ARcwkxCKZn)](https://codecov.io/gh/ProtonMail/vobject)


The VObject library allows you to easily parse and manipulate [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)
and [vCard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350) objects using PHP.

The goal of the VObject library is to create a very complete library, with an easy to use API.

    composer require protonlabs/vobject "^4.0"
