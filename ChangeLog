3.0.0-alpha3 (2013-05-??)
	* Changed: propertyMap, valueMap and componentMap are now static
	  properties.
	* Changed: Component::remove() will throw an exception when trying to
	  a node that's not a child of said component.

3.0.0-alpha2 (2013-05-22)
	* Fixed: vCard URL properties were referencing a non-existant class.

3.0.0-alpha1 (2013-05-21)
	* Fixed: Now correctly dealing with escaping of properties. This solves
	  the problem with double-backslashes where they don't belong.
	* Added: Easy support for properties with more than one value, using
	  setParts and getParts.
	* Added: Support for broken 2.1 vCards produced by microsoft.
	* Added: Automatically decoding quoted-printable values.
	* Added: Automatically decoding base64 values.
	* Added: Decoding RFC6868 parameter values (uses ^ as an escape
	  character).
	* Added: Fancy new MimeDir parser that can also parse streams.
	* Added: Automatically mapping many, many properties to a property-class
	  with specialized API's.
	* Added: remove() method for easily removing properties and sub-components
	  components.
	* Changed: Components, Properties and Parameters can no longer be created
	  with Component::create, Property::create and Parameter::create. They
	  must instead be created through the root component. (A VCalendar or
	  VCard object).
	* Changed: API for DateTime properties has slightly changed.
	* Changed: the ->value property is now protected everywhere. Use
	  getParts() and getValue() instead.
	* BC Break: No support for mac newlines (\r). Never came across these
	  anyway.
	* Added: add() method to the Property class.
	* Added: It's now possible to easy set multi-value properties as arrays.
	* Added: When setting date-time properties you can just pass PHP's
	  DateTime object.
	* Added: New components automatically get a bunch of default properties,
	  such as VERSION and CALSCALE.
	* Added: You can add new sub-components much quicker with the magic
	  setters, and add() method.

2.1.0-stable (2013-??-??)
	* This version is fully backwards compatible with 2.0.*. However, it
	  contains a few new API's that mimic the VObject 3 API. This allows it to
	  be used a 'bridge' version.
	  Specifically, this new version exists so SabreDAV 1.7 and 1.8 can run with
	  both the 2 and 3 versions of this library.
	* Added: Property\DateTime::hasTime().
	* Added: Property\MultiDateTime::hasTime().
	* Added: Property::getValue().
	* Added: Document class.
	* Added: Document::createComponent and Document::createProperty.

2.0.7-stable (2013-03-05)
	* Fixed: Microsoft re-uses their magic numbers for different timezones,
	  specifically id 2 for both Sarajevo and Lisbon). A workaround was added
	  to deal with this.

2.0.6-stable (2013-02-17)
	* Fixed: The reader now properly parses parameters without a value.

2.0.5-stable (2012-11-05)
	* Fixed: The FreeBusyGenerator is now properly using the factory methods
	  for creation of components and properties.

2.0.4-stable (2012-11-02)
	* Added: Known Lotus Notes / Domino timezone id's.

2.0.3-stable (2012-10-29)
	* Added: Support for 'GMT+????' format in TZID's.
	* Added: Support for formats like SystemV/EST5EDT in TZID's.
	* Fixed: RecurrenceIterator now repairs recurrence rules where UNTIL < DTSTART.
	* Added: Support for BYHOUR in FREQ=DAILY (@hollodk).
	* Added: Support for BYHOUR and BYDAY in FREQ=WEEKLY.

2.0.2-stable (2012-10-06)
	* Added: includes.php file, to load the entire library in one go.
	* Fixed: A problem with determining alarm triggers for TODO's.

2.0.1-stable (2012-09-22)
	* Removed: Element class. It wasn't used.
	* Added: Basic validation and repair methods for broken input data.
	* Fixed: RecurrenceIterator could infinitely loop when an INTERVAL of 0
	  was specified.
	* Added: A cli script that can validate and automatically repair vcards
	  and iCalendar objects.
	* Added: A new 'Compound' property, that can automatically split up parts
	  for properties such as N, ADR, ORG and CATEGORIES.
	* Added: Splitter classes, that can split up large objects (such as exports)
	  into individual objects (thanks @DominikTO and @armin-hackmann).
	* Added: VFREEBUSY component, which allows easily checking wether
	  timeslots are available.
	* Added: The Reader class now has a 'FORGIVING' option, which allows it to
	  parse properties with incorrect characters in the name (at this time, it
	  just allows underscores).
	* Added: Also added the 'IGNORE_INVALID_LINES' option, to completely
	  disregard any invalid lines.
	* Fixed: A bug in Windows timezone-id mappings for times created in
	  Greenlands timezone (sorry Greenlanders! I do care!).
	* Fixed: DTEND was not generated correctly for VFREEBUSY reports.
	* Fixed: Parser is at least 25% faster with real-world data.

2.0.0-stable (2012-08-08)
	* VObject is now a separate project from SabreDAV. See the SabreDAV
	  changelog for version information before 2.0.
