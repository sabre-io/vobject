2.1.3-stable (2013-10-02)
	* Fixed: Issue #55. \r must be stripped from property values.
	* Fixed: Issue #65. Putting quotes around parameter values that contain a
	  colon.

2.1.2-stable (2013-08-02)
	* Fixed: Issue #53. A regression in RecurrenceIterator.

2.1.1-stable (2013-07-27)
	* Fixed: Issue #50. RecurrenceIterator gives incorrect result when
	  exception events are out of order in the iCalendar file.
	* Fixed: Issue #48. Overridden events in the recurrence iterator that were
	  past the UNTIL date were ignored.

2.1.0-stable (2013-06-17)
	* This version is fully backwards compatible with 2.0.*. However, it
	  contains a few new API's that mimic the VObject 3 API. This allows it to
	  be used a 'bridge' version.
	  Specifically, this new version exists so SabreDAV 1.7 and 1.8 can run with
	  both the 2 and 3 versions of this library.
	* Added: Property\DateTime::hasTime().
	* Added: Property\MultiDateTime::hasTime().
	* Added: Property::getValue().
	* Added: Document class.
	* Added: Document::createComponent and Document::createProperty.
	* Added: Parameter::getValue().


2.0.7-stable (2013-03-05)
	* Fixed: Microsoft re-uses their magic numbers for different timezones,
	  specifically id 2 for both Sarajevo and Lisbon). A workaround was added
	  to deal with this.

2.0.6-stable (2013-02-17)
	* Fixed: The reader now properly parses parameters without a value.

2.0.5-stable (2012-11-05)
	* Fixed: The FreeBusyGenerator is now properly using the factory methods
	  for creation of components and properties.

2.0.4-stable (2012-11-02)
	* Added: Known Lotus Notes / Domino timezone id's.

2.0.3-stable (2012-10-29)
	* Added: Support for 'GMT+????' format in TZID's.
	* Added: Support for formats like SystemV/EST5EDT in TZID's.
	* Fixed: RecurrenceIterator now repairs recurrence rules where UNTIL < DTSTART.
	* Added: Support for BYHOUR in FREQ=DAILY (@hollodk).
	* Added: Support for BYHOUR and BYDAY in FREQ=WEEKLY.

2.0.2-stable (2012-10-06)
	* Added: includes.php file, to load the entire library in one go.
	* Fixed: A problem with determining alarm triggers for TODO's.

2.0.1-stable (2012-09-22)
	* Removed: Element class. It wasn't used.
	* Added: Basic validation and repair methods for broken input data.
	* Fixed: RecurrenceIterator could infinitely loop when an INTERVAL of 0
	  was specified.
	* Added: A cli script that can validate and automatically repair vcards
	  and iCalendar objects.
	* Added: A new 'Compound' property, that can automatically split up parts
	  for properties such as N, ADR, ORG and CATEGORIES.
	* Added: Splitter classes, that can split up large objects (such as exports)
	  into individual objects (thanks @DominikTO and @armin-hackmann).
	* Added: VFREEBUSY component, which allows easily checking wether
	  timeslots are available.
	* Added: The Reader class now has a 'FORGIVING' option, which allows it to
	  parse properties with incorrect characters in the name (at this time, it
	  just allows underscores).
	* Added: Also added the 'IGNORE_INVALID_LINES' option, to completely
	  disregard any invalid lines.
	* Fixed: A bug in Windows timezone-id mappings for times created in
	  Greenlands timezone (sorry Greenlanders! I do care!).
	* Fixed: DTEND was not generated correctly for VFREEBUSY reports.
	* Fixed: Parser is at least 25% faster with real-world data.

2.0.0-stable (2012-08-08)
	* VObject is now a separate project from SabreDAV. See the SabreDAV
	  changelog for version information before 2.0.
	* New: VObject library now uses PHP 5.3 namespaces.
	* New: It's possible to specify lists of parameters when constructing
	  properties.
	* New: made it easier to construct the FreeBusyGenerator.
